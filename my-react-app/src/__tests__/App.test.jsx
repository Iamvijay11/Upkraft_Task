  // Additional tests would go here:
  // - Test that main components render
  // - Test responsive behavior
  // - Test user interactions
  // - Test accessibility features
});

// Note: This is a placeholder test structure.
// In a real project, you would need to:
// 1. Install @testing-library/react and @testing-library/jest-dom
// 2. Configure Jest and testing environment
// 3. Add proper test utilities and mocks
